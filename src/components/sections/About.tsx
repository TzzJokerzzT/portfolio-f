      <p>
        Back in 2019, I decided to start learn programming but I really don't
        know where or what to start, so I take a internet course about basic
        programming and I feel this is want I really do for my rest of my life.
        I decided learning Front End because the sensation that I feel building
        thing that some other people can see or use made me feel great.

        My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces. I most
        enjoy building web or web apps in the sweet spot where design and
        engineering meet ‚Äî things that look good but are also built well under
        the hood.

        When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually play video games like RPG
        (Final Fantasy), adventure (Zelda) and fighting games (Street Fighter)
        also I like to participate in profesional fighting games competition,
        some I just sit and watch anime or just running through Silent Hill to feel
        some adrenaline on my body üòÅ
